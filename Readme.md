Redis Implementation of Socket.IO Store
=======================================

  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/1F3V1Z3u422O3p1P0X0k/really.gif)

&lt;blink&gt; _This Storage/Dispatch engine for Socket.IO is under active development. It is not ready for production._ &lt;/blink&gt;

In order to make this viable, I am working on patching Socket.IO. That code can be found in my fork: [/dshaw/Socket.IO-node](https://github.com/dshaw/Socket.IO-node/tree/extern/). Forks and contributions are welcome.


Testing
--------

    `npm test`
